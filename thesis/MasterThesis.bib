Paper laying the foundation for FLA processing of HZO films. Showing that it is
possible with a MIM structure and achieved similar results to their RTP
processed sample. Contains a bunch of good sources for the basics of HZO and how
FLA might improve these devices.
Key takeaways:
- HfO2 already used in CMOS processing --> good compatibility.
- They show that the preheating temperature is insufficient for crystallization
(375C). I should do the same!
- CV peaks coincide with Ec. Capacitance increases as charges move (switching).
- Cites many sources for why the graphs look like they do. Worth to check out!

A review on the state of FTJs from 2014. No mention of HZO and much focus on the
ON/OFF ratio of the ferroelectric materials of the time. Has some good figures
in the beginning explaining how the FE controls tunneling and mentions the
different tunneling mechanics.
Key takeaways:
- FeRAMs are commencially available. Bulky (>100nm) and troublesum to read from.
- FTJs have good ON/OFF ratios and give non-destructive readout.
- There are three main tunneling mechanics (Direct, Fowler-Nordheim and
Thermionic)
- The polarisation is not completely screened which gives bandbending in the
electrodes --> If the screening length is different between the electrodes, this
can be used to control tunneling.
- The concept of FTJs was proposed 1971 but was forgotten since it was believed
to not work on small structures. The FE on ultrathin films was then demostrated
in 2009.
- There were issues with the endurance with these types of FTJs aswell (<10⁶)
- Combining FE with Ferromagnetic electrodes gives special interactions. Mention
as an application in my intrpduction?

A description of the uni-directional CV method for determining defect densities
of oxides. Compares with the traditional bi-directional CV method and gives
insight into the workings of both methods and how they complement eachother.
Somewhat unclear if this is in contradiction to Robins explaination in
Athle2022improved.
Key takeaways:
- The hysteresis in the uni-CV method is both time and voltage dependant since
even if the fermi level changes due to a change in voltage the trapping time
constant determines if a trap is active of not.
- The equation used (eq1) assumes a chargesheet --> Numbers could be
underestimations of the true defect density.
- The hysteresis can arrise from the ferroelectric switching as well. We must
hence be very careful not to go above the coercive field.
- Improved performance could also be achieved by moving the trap energies away
from the bandgap. However, the voltage required to write to FeFETs are generally
higher which means we must also redice the defect density.
- Bi-CV gives a depth profile on the order of a couple of nm (bulk) while the
uni-CV takes everything (including interfaces). Through both methods we can find
that the majority of defects are located at the interface.
- The defect density at the interfaces does not change significantly between 10
to 10^6 cycles which means the degradation of the memory window is probably due
to bulk defects pinning the FE domains. However, the uni-method should be able
to see these defects aswell but the defect could be out of the time window for
the measurements.

Not a super relevant paper for my thesis. Used PLA for crystallisation with both
ns and ms pulses. The ns pulses were insufficient for crystallisation while the
ms pulses gave comparable results to RTP and could probably be optimized
further.
Key takeaways:
- PLA gives better control over the crystallisation parameters.
- Pulses shorter than 50ns are insufficient for crystallisation (atleast with
realistic thinknesses grown on Si)
- The pulse duration can affect phase composition of the HZO film! This is clear
in classical nucleation theory. Include in thesis?

Very good structure and flow. Adapt this structure into your thesis!
Growing HfO2 using plasma enchanced ALD was studied for varying parameters (First ever FE using PE-ALD).
Optimization of MIM structures. Brings up different leakage mechanics.

An expanssion upon my thesis work. Includes everything I did and some XPS.
Many interesting thoughts that I should incorporate somehow with the addition of
further explaination for the defects and methods used.
Key takeaways:
- Tpeak simulations differ due to ideal TiN vs real TiN. But is good
approximation.
- XPS shows a reduction of As2O3-defects in FLA by roughy half. Moreover, a
reduction of the As0-peaks (Metallic As) are also found in the fitting which are
known to be the main source of interface defects in InAs/high-k oxide
interfaces. These are especially detrimental for device performance.
- TiN is known to scavenge oxygen from HZO (TiOxNy). The improved endurance 
could be attributed to reduced thermal budget which limits the scavaging of 
oxygen by the TiN electrode. 
- Uni-CV and bi-directional CV are complementary. bi-directional shows interface
defects while Uni-CV integrates into the (full) oxide. I should have both!
- A higher defect density is observed for RTP however since it also has a higher
Pr it is not a straight forward comparisson due to the increased bandbending
(could introduce more traps). However, the 32.5 J/cm2 sample shows a
slightly higher defect density with a lower Pr which suggests the defects are
indeed related to the thermal budget.
- Increased ALD temperature is in itself somewhat detrimental to the HZO film.
This is shown by the defect density being lower in the 25J flash @200C compared
to the 20J flash @270C.
