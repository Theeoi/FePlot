# FePlot

Data analysis and plotting library for my master thesis work conducted at
the Department of Electrical and Informations Technology, Faculty of
Engineering, Lund University.
The repo currently contains both the Python code and my thesis written in
LaTeX.

The code presented here is written over quite some time with a MATLAB mindset
and is pretty bad. I'm currently working on a big refactor of the project with
the goal of reducing the coupling and increasing code cohesion.

## TODO

 - Refactor everything. Check the 'devel' branch for more information.
