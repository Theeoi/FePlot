# MasterThesis

Collection area for all files relating to my master thesis project conducted at
the Department of Electrical and Informations Technology, Faculty of
Engineering, Lund University.
The repo contains both my Python code for analysis and my thesis written in
LaTeX.

The code presented here is written over quite some time with a MATLAB mindset
and is pretty bad. I'm currently working on a big refactor of the project with
the goal of reducing the coupling and increasing code cohesion.

## Install

Having MasterThesis as the working directory run 
`pip install .`
and all program dependancies will be installed.

To use the program run
`python -m src`

## TODO
(in no perticular order)

 - Figure out how to run the program without 'python -m'
 - Start writing tests for the already implemented code
 - Refactor the already implemented code according to the tests
 - Move code from "Code"-directory to src as implementation continues
 - Refactor Cleaning scripts to organise the data in a meaningful way (bash or
   python?)
