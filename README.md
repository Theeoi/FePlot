# MasterThesis

Collection area for all files relating to my master thesis project conducted at
the Department of Electrical and Informations Technology, Faculty of
Engineering, Lund University.
The repo contains both my Python code for analysis and my thesis written in
LaTeX.

The code presented here is written over quite some time with a MATLAB mindset
and is pretty bad. I'm currently working on a big refactor of the project with
the goal of reducing the coupling and increasing code cohesion.

## TODO

 - Refactor everything. Check the 'devel' branch for more information.
